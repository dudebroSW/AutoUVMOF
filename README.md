# AutoUV MOF Bridge (for Blender)

[![Blender Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-3.6.4+-orange)](https://www.blender.org/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](LICENSE)

Professional UV unwrapping integration between Blender and Ministry of Flat (MOF). This add-on lets you use MOF directly in Blender to unwrap your meshes quickly. Instead of manually exporting files and running commands, it handles everything with one click ‚Äì it exports your mesh, runs MOF‚Äôs unwrapping tools, and brings the new UVs back into Blender. Your original UVs stay untouched as backups, and the new MOF-generated UVs get added as a separate layer. It also copies over sharp edges and materials and can optionally replace your original mesh with the MOF-processed version (while keeping its position/rotation). Requires MOF installed separately. Useful for game assets, architectural models, or any project where you need clean, automated UV unwrapping.

## Installation

1. **Download** [Ministry of Flat](https://www.quelsolaar.com/ministry_of_flat/) executables
2. **Download** the [latest release ZIP](https://github.com/dudebroSW/AutoUVMOF/releases/) from this GitHub page
3. **Install in Blender**:
   - Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install
   - Select downloaded ZIP file
   - Enable the add-on
4. **Configure MOF Path**:
   - Open add-on preferences
   - Set path to Ministry of Flat (MOF) directory containing executable files

## Usage

1. Select **one or more** mesh objects (all selected objects must be meshes).
2. Open the "AutoUV MOF Bridge" panel (N-panel > AutoUV MOF Bridge).
3. Adjust parameters (optional):
   - **Core Settings:** Resolution, Separate Hard Edges, etc.
   - **Advanced:** Toggle options for mesh replacement, UV transfers, and more.
4. Click the operator button:
   - When a single mesh is selected, the button reads **"Auto UV Unwrap"**.
   - When multiple meshes are selected, the button reads **"Auto UV Unwrap (Batch)"**.
5. During batch processing, a progress bar in Blender‚Äôs status bar will indicate how far along the process is.

### Advanced Settings

| Parameter                  | Description                                                                                   | Default |

## Key Functionality

### Batch Processing
- **Batch Processing:** The add-on now supports unwrapping multiple meshes simultaneously. When more than one mesh is selected, the operator processes each mesh sequentially.

### Mesh Replacement
When enabled:
- Preserves materials and transforms  
- Applies automatic rotation correction  
- Maintains object relationships  
- Cleans up temporary data automatically  

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**  
- **"Operation not available":**  
  ‚Üí Ensure that all selected objects are meshes  
- **Rotation mismatch:**  
  ‚Üí Enable mesh replacement for auto-correction  
- **Missing MOF executable:**  
  ‚Üí Verify the MOF directory path in add-on preferences  
- **Batch Process Freezes/No Feedback:**  
  ‚Üí Check that your system meets the minimum Blender version requirements (3.6.4+)
