# AutoUV MOF Bridge (for Blender)

Professional UV unwrapping integration between Blender and Ministry of Flat (MOF). This add-on lets you use MOF directly in Blender to unwrap your meshes quickly. Instead of manually exporting files and running commands, it handles everything with one click ‚Äì it exports your mesh, runs MOF‚Äôs unwrapping tools, and brings the new UVs back into Blender. Your original UVs stay untouched as backups, and the new MOF-generated UVs get added as a separate layer. It also copies over sharp edges and materials, and can optionally replace your original mesh with the MOF-processed version (while keeping its position/rotation). Requires MOF installed separately. Useful for game assets, architectural models, or any project where you need clean, automated UV unwrapping.

## Features

- üéõÔ∏è Single-click UV unwrapping utilizing MOF engine
- üìè Resolution presets from 32 to 4096
- üîÑ Aspect ratio control for non-square textures
- üó∫Ô∏è World-space scaling and texture density

## Installation

1. **Download** [Ministry of Flat](https://www.quelsolaar.com/ministry_of_flat/) executables
2. **Download** the latest release ZIP from this GitHub page
3. **Install in Blender**:
   - Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install
   - Select downloaded ZIP file
   - Enable the add-on
4. **Configure MOF Path**:
   - Open add-on preferences
   - Set path to Ministry of Flat (MOF) directory containing executable files

## Usage

1. Select **exactly one** mesh object
2. Open "AutoUV MOF Bridge" panel (N-panel > AutoUV MOF Bridge)
3. Adjust parameters (optional):
   - **Core Settings**: Resolution, Aspect Ratio, etc.
   - **Advanced**: Toggle mesh replacement
4. Click "Auto UV Unwrap"

### Core Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Resolution | Texture resolution (determines island spacing) | 1024 |
| Aspect Ratio | Width/height ratio for non-square textures | 1.0 |
| Separate Hard Edges | Guarantees hard edges are separated for baking | False |
| Use Normals | Use mesh normals for polygon classification | False |
| Overlap Identical Parts | Overlap identical geometry in UV space | False |
| Overlap Mirrored Parts | Overlap mirrored geometry in UV space | False |
| UDIM Tiles | Number of UDIM tiles for texture splitting | 1 |
| World Scale | Scale UVs to real-world dimensions | False |
| Texture Density | Pixels per unit in world scale mode | 1024 |

### Advanced Settings

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Replace Original Mesh | Replace original geometry with processed version | False |

## Key Functionality

### Mesh Replacement
When enabled:
- Preserves materials and transforms
- Applies automatic rotation correction
- Maintains object relationships
- Cleans up temporary data automatically

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Original UV maps are preserved in replacement mesh.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**  
- "Operation not available"  
  ‚Üí Select exactly one mesh object  
- Rotation mismatch  
  ‚Üí Enable mesh replacement for auto-correction  
- Missing MOF executable  
  ‚Üí Verify path in add-on preferences
